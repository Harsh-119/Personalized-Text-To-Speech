# Pets - Personalized Text-to-Speech

## Overview

The English language can be reduced to 39 fundamental sounds known as "phonemes." 
Each phoneme is represented by a specific character, and these representations collectively from the [ARPAbet set](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict).

**Pets** (Personalized Text-to-Speech) is a Python application designed to convert input text into phonemes and play corresponding audio files.
